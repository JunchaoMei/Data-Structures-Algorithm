Problem: Does G have a clique of size k? A clique is a subset of vertices such that every pair of vertices in the subset is joined by an edge.
Inputs: (G, k) where G is an undirected graph and k an integer. 
Outputs: true / false as appropriate.

boolean verify (graph G, number k, V¡ã)
{
	if (|V¡ã|>k)
	{
	    if (every pair of vertices u,v¡ÊV¡ã, edge (u,v) is in E)
		return true;
	    else
		return false
	} else
	    return false;
}//end verify
